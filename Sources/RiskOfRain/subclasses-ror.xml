                <text>At 3rd level, you gain this ability. Each time you use the dash action, the critical strike threshold of your next attack is reduced by 2. This bonus can stack and resets to your normal amount each time you make an attack roll.</text>

The glaive can bounce up to two times, hitting a total of three different targets.</text>
